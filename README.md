-# Hi, I'm Anna (aka @ReviIsCoding) 👋

I'm transitioning from a non-technical background into the field of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Science**, and **LLM-based technologies**.  
Currently, I'm building my foundations in **Python programming**, **data analysis**, and **prompt engineering**, with a strong focus on understanding how AI can augment real-world tasks.

## 🌱 What I'm currently learning:
- Python programming for AI applications (FastAPI, LangChain basics)
- Working with data (SQL basics, embeddings, vector databases)
- Fundamentals of **LLMs** (Large Language Models) and **AI Agents** (ReAct, CoT frameworks)
- Building simple **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipelines
- Best practices in **prompt engineering** and **LLM evaluation**

## 🛠️ My growing skills include:
- Python for automation and AI prototyping
- Prompt engineering techniques (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain of Thought)
- Basics of embeddings, vector search, and document retrieval
- Using tools like LangChain, OpenAI API, Vertex AI
- Data analysis and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

## 📚 My learning journey:
I come from a humanities background (Archaeology) and I’m passionate about combining **analytical thinking** with **new technologies**.  
I'm continuously expanding my technical skills to bridge the gap between data understanding and intelligent systems design.

## ✨ About me:
- Lifelong learner with a passion for AI and technology
- Enjoys building projects step-by-step, even when things get challenging
- Believes in interdisciplinary thinking — tech needs diverse minds!

## ⚡ Fun fact:
Archaeologists don't dig up dinosaurs... but if I could build a dinosaur AI agent, I'd definitely do it. 🦖
